## Analysis

In this notebook, a system of differential equations describing standard dark matter and radiation, the Hubble expansion, and dark energy with a non-linear quadratic equation of state (EoS) is analysed. Non-singular bouncing models are the generic closed model when only dark matter with a quadratic EoS is present. The aim of this analysis is to understand the effect dark matter and radiation have on these closed bouncing models. The full system is 4-dimensional, therefore we project the dynamics on to 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional planes by integrating the dark matter and radition differential equations with respect to the dark energy.

This analysis in the notebook provides:

+ the fixed points of the full system of equations and the sub-manifolds with their eigenvalues,
+ analysis of the range of Einstein fixed points that can be admitted by the system
+ calculations of the values of the first integrals needed for each dynamical case,
+ plots of the sub-manifolds with their potentials,
+ plots of each dynamical case in the full system with their potentials in terms of different variables in 2-dimensions and in 3-dimenions.

We also investigate a similar system, except we enforce an upper bound on the matter and radiation components. This analysis includes:

+ the fixed points of the system with their eigenvalues,
+ analysis of the range of Einstein fixed points possible,
+ calculations of the values of the first integrals needed to produce the different dynamical cases, 
+ plots of the phase spaces with their potentials in 2-dimensions.
