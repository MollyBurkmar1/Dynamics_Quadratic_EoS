# Dynamics of Dark Matter, Radiation and Dark Energy with a Non-Linear Quadratic Equation of State

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, the user requires a Mathematica license and to have installed MaTeX (see https://github.com/szhorvat/MaTeX).

## Analysis

In this notebook, a system of differential equations describing dark matter, radiation, the Hubble expansion, and dark energy with a non-linear quadratic equation of state is analysed. Focus on bounces. Projection of phase spaces.

This analysis in the notebook provides

+ the fixed points and eigenvalues of the full system and sub-manifolds
+ Calculations of c_r
+ calculations of c_z in the limiting cases
+ Analysis of the EoS of DE
+ Plots of the sub-manifolds
+ Plots of the phase spaces in the full system -> 2D, 3D and ay
+ Plots of the phase space for the full system with matter and radiation upper bounds
